<h2>Overview</h2>
YYour challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [x] View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - [x] The input field is empty
  - [x] The email address is not formatted correctly

<h2>Satisfaction</h2>
<h3>The Good</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I am happy with the layout and structure of the code.</li>
    <li>Input field was designed exactly how I planned for.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The desktop responsive code got messy.</li>
    <li>The original styling was replaced, perhaps take it slower next time?</li>
  </ul>

<!-- UPDATE ENTIRE SECTION -->
<h2>The Process</h2>
<h3>Tools</h3>

  <img alt="HTML5" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-red?style=flat-square&logo=html5&logoColor=white" />
  <img alt="CSS3" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-blue?style=flat-square&logo=css3&logoColor=white" />
  <img alt="JavaScript" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-yellow?style=flat-square&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=white" />
  
  <img alt="SASS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-SASS-bf4080?style=flat-square&logo=sass&logoColor=white" />
</p>
<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    I learnt how to effectively use the sibling selectors for CSS ( ~ + ). By doing so, I was able to create a
    validation form without touching any JavaScript.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I am happy with the development of this project, however; resturcutring the HTML for a readable code would have been nice.
